    "- What is the theoretical O(n) time & space complexity in terms of input size?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Random Forest is an ensemble model of decision trees. Time complexity for building a complete unpruned decision tree is `O( f * n log(n) )`, where `n` is the sample size and `f` is the number of features. While building random forests you have to define the number of trees you want to build (assume it to be, `ntree`) and how many features you want to sample at each node (assume it to be, `ftry`).  Since we would only use `ftry` features at each node the complexity to build one tree would be `O( ftry * n log(n) )`. Now for building a random forest with `ntree` number of trees, the complexity would be `O( ntree * ftry * nlog(n) )` This is the worst case scenario, i.e., assuming the depth of the tree is going to be `O(log n)`. But in most cases the build process of a tree stops much before this and it is hard to estimate. But you could also restrict the depth of the trees that you would be building in your random forest. say you restrict the maximum depth of your tree to be `d` then the complexity calculations can be simplified to: `O( ntree * ftry * d * n)`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The space complexity is `O(f n log(n))` with `f` is the number of features and `n` the number of elements in the dataset, under the assumption that a reasonably symmetric tree is built and that the evaluation of a single test takes constant time in the size of the dataset.\n",

    "- What are the general applications of this model? What are its strengths and weaknesses?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Some applications where it can be used are:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In bioinformatics to study genes.\n",
    "    In video tagging.\n",
    "    In image classification.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Based on the experiments you performed earlier, in 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors what single model you chose as the best model. Which model is generally the most appropriate based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Support Vector Machine model is what I am using as the best model as it is the most appropriate and accurate model for the data we have at hand based on my analysis. It gave us the highest accuracy(f1 score) and was able to make the computations(both training and testing) in `0.017` seconds which is reasonably fast enough for our analysis. As far as resources and cost are concerned, SVMs are computationaly relatively light as they do not use the entire dataset to make their predictions and use only a subset of relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors in layman's terms how the final model chosen is supposed to work (for example if you chose a Decision Tree or Support Vector Machine, how does it make a prediction).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    On a very high level, SVMs find a seperating line between data of two classes. Support vector machines are based on the concept of maximising the distance between datapoints of different classes and the seperating line. Think of it this way, if we have two kinds of chocolates and want to seperate them out using a ruler, we can do so placing the ruler in between the two types of chocolates and our objective is to increase the distance between the chocolate of that is closest to the ruler of one kind, and conversely between the chocolate of the second kind and the ruler. \n",
    "   \n",
    "    Also, SVMs can be used to seperate data that cannot be separated using just a straight line using what is called a 'Kernel Trick' which is what I have used in my algorithm as well. I tuned my SVM model to get a higher F-1 score using the Grid Search technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tune the model. Use Gridsearch with at least one important parameter tuned and with at least 3 settings. Use the entire training set for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the model's final F<sub>1</sub> score?\n",
